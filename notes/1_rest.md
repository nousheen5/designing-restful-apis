# TOOLS
1) we can check output of apis directly using VS or VS code:
    - .http/.rest extension to file, write request urls and execute
    - get rest client extension (vs code)


# Web dev basics
1) client ---> server(data center/cloud/computer that is present in your organisation)
2) request contents
    ~ verb - what we want to do from the request
    ~ header - information about the request
    ~ content - the actual request
3) response contents
    ~ status code
    ~ headers
    ~ content
4) the server here is stateless -  it means that the server does not retain any information about the client's previous requests. Each request from a client to the server is treated as an independent, isolated transaction that has no relationship to any previous requests
